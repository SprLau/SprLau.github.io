## Practice Set 1

***[Description]***<br><br>
Punggaw loves drinking milk tea, Punglau loves even more.<br>
One day, they go into HEYTEA®, hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder, and check the menu.<br>
But as Punglau wants to order so many kinds of milk tea that Punggaw can hardly remember them all, so it is ought to be a computer program to help Punggaw outta this situation.<br>
It happens that Punggaw is learning Python recently, so she plans to code herself.<br>
Punglau will firstly tell Punggaw how many cups he’s gonna order, and each time give a tea name, so that Punggaw can put them into a list.<br><br>
***[Input Example]***<br><br>
4<br>
Burnt Sugar Bobo Milk Tea<br>
Many Meat MangoMango<br>
Bobo Milk Tea<br>
Many Meat Grapes<br><br>
***[Output Example]***<br><br>
[‘Burnt Sugar Bobo Milk Tea’, ‘Many Meat MangoMango’, ‘Bobo Milk Tea’, ‘Many Meat Grapes’]<br><br>
## Practice Set 2
 
***[Description]***<br><br>
Because Punglau orders too many cups, he cannot drink them all, qwq.<br>
So he turns to Punggaw, but unfortunately, Punggaw also doesn’t have that kind of gigantic stomach. So Punggaw suggests playing a game…<br>
Which is quite simple:<br>
Regarding a certain N cups of milk tea, for each of them, extract the Kth letter, and make up a word. N and K is told by Punglau, and because Punglau is getting more han these days thanks to computer organization courses, Punggaw has to help her han Punglau.<br><br>
***[Input Example 1]***<br><br>

Burnt Sugar Bobo Milk Tea<br>
Many Meat MangoMango<br><br>

***[Output Example 2]***<br><br>
rnbn<br><br>
***[Instructions]***<br><br>
In the first example, there are 2 cups of tea and you have to extract the 5th letter in each name of tea to form ‘t ’ (including blank space);<br>
In the second example, there are 4 cups of tea and you have to extract the 3rd letter in each name of tea to form ‘rnbn’.<br><br>
## Practice Set 3
 
***[Description]***<br><br>

## Practice Set 4

***[Description]***<br><br>
Punggaw finally returns to UCB!!! After meeting her classmates, they unanimously elect Punggaw as their technology chairman, for she’s the only one in the art major who has mastered Python3!!!<br>
Immediately, Punggaw’s mentor gives her a task:<br>
To decide who to be the teacher’s assistant, the mentor plans to choose the one has the longest name. The mentor would like to tell you how many students are there, so that Punggaw can put them into a list, and generate the teacher’s assistant.<br><br>
***[Input Example]***<br><br>
3<br>
Punglau<br>
Jiang Ying<br>
SAY<br><br>
***[Output Example]***<br><br>
Jiang Ying<br><br>
## Practice Set 5

***[Description]***<br><br>
How time flies! Punggaw has been in the campus for almost a semester, and subsequently, Punggaw has to take her first final in the UCB. After going through her practices, Punggaw is uncontrollably excited, because she finds out that her correctness possibility for each single question is 90%. But her mentor tells her, albeit 90%, it is still not easy to get a 100 full mark in the impending exam. Punggaw doesn’t believe her mentor, so she decided to remonstrate by calculating the possibility herself.
Presuming that Punggaw wants a 50% chance to get a full mark, how many questions, at most, should be presented by teachers.<br><br>
## Practice Set 6

***[Description]***<br><br>
胖刘不太聪明的样子。最近他老是搞不清楚标点符号怎么用，<br>
胖高很担心！所以就设计了一个程序来帮胖刘检查标点符号的对错？<br>
这个程序是这样的；<br>
把所有出现在非句子末尾的句点找出来并统计个数。若末尾不是句点。则也算作错误，<br><br>
***[Input Example 1]***<br><br>
Punglau loves jinjianceng. Puanggaw loves too,<br><br>
***[Output Example 1]***<br><br>
2<br><br>
***[Explanation 1]***<br><br>
这个句子句中出现了”.”，且末尾不是”.”，则统计出两处。<br><br>
***[Input Example 2]***<br><br>
Punglau loves jinjianceng. Puanggaw loves too. but SAY and JAY don’t allow.<br><br>
***[Output Example 2]***<br><br>
2<br><br>
***[Explanation 2]***<br><br>
这个句子句中出现了两处”.”，但末尾符合规则，是”.”，则仅需要统计句中的两处。<br><br>
## Practice Set 7
 
***[Description]***<br><br>
Punglau is a math geek, but he actually doesn’t know anything about math…<br>
Recently he is befuddled by a math trick, which is:<br>
Based on the mode F(n) = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + … + 1/n<br>
For each n, what an integer must be, as small as possible, to be bigger than F(n).<br><br>
For an input, Punggaw will get an n from Punglau, and outputs an integer that meets the requirement.<br><br>
***[Input Example]***<br><br>
3<br><br>
***[Output Example]***<br><br>
2<br><br>
***[Explanation]***<br><br>
Given n is 3, so F(n) = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 1.8333333…<br>
So the legal integer would be 2. (2 is the known smallest integer that bigger than 1.8333333…)<br><br>

## Practice Set 9

***[Description]***<br><br>
Punglau is obsessed with HeyTea and Starbucks, he is extremely happy to know that, with every 3 cups of HeyTea, he can get a coupon for a cup of Starbucks for FREE!!<br>
So suggesting Punggaw buys X cups of HeyTea and Y cups Starbucks for Punglau, how many cups of HeyTea & Starbucks, IN TOTAL, can Punglau drink.<br><br>
***[Input Example]***<br><br>
7<br>
2<br><br>
***[Output Example]***<br><br>
11<br><br>
***[Explanation]***<br><br>
According to the description, in 7 cups of HeyTea, 2 cups additional is for free, so in all, there are 7 + 2 + 2 cups for Punglau to drink.<br><br> 
## Practice Set 10

***[Description]***<br><br>
One day, what a coincidence, the manager of HeyTea happened to walk into Punggaw. At that very moment, Punggaw was buying her 7 cups of HeyTea for Punglau. The manager was touched by Punggaw’s largess and named Punggaw the SVIP of HeyTea!! Which means Punggaw can get access to the privilege that, no matter under what circumstance, as long as Punggaw has 3 cups of HeyTea in her hands, she can get 1 extra for free.<br>
Punglau was even happier when he hears this, so Punggaw, to feed her dumbass boyfriend well, has to calculate how many cups can she get in a purchase.<br><br>
***[Input Example]***<br><br>
14<br><br>
***[Output Example]***<br><br>
19<br><br>
***[Explanation]***<br><br>
According to the description:<br>
[14 / 3] = 4<br>
[4 / 3] = 1 <br>
(where […] means int(…))<br><br>
So, at last, there are 19 cups.<br><br>
