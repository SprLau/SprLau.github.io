## Practice 1

**_\[Description\]_**

Punggaw loves drinking milk tea, Punglau loves even more.

One day, they go into HEYTEA®, hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder, and check the menu.

But as Punglau wants to order so many kinds of milk tea that Punggaw can hardly remember them all, so it is ought to be a computer program to help Punggaw outta this situation.

It happens that Punggaw is learning Python recently, so she plans to code herself.

Punglau will firstly tell Punggaw how many cups he’s gonna order, and each time give a tea name, so that Punggaw can put them into a list.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

4

Burnt Sugar Bobo Milk Tea

Many Meat MangoMango

Bobo Milk Tea

Many Meat Grapes

**_\[Output Example\]_**

\[‘Burnt Sugar Bobo Milk Tea’, ‘Many Meat MangoMango’, ‘Bobo Milk Tea’, ‘Many Meat Grapes’\]

## Practice 2

**_\[Description\]_**

Because Punglau orders too many cups, he cannot drink them all, qwq.

So he turns to Punggaw, but unfortunately, Punggaw also doesn’t have that kind of gigantic stomach. So Punggaw suggests playing a game…

Which is quite simple:

Regarding a certain N cups of milk tea, for each of them, extract the Kth letter, and make up a word. N and K is told by Punglau, and because Punglau is getting more han these days thanks to computer organization courses, Punggaw has to help her han Punglau.

**_\[Input Example 1\]_**

Bobo Milk Tea

Many Meat Grapes

**_\[Output Example 2\]_**

rnbn

**_\[Instructions\]_**

In the first example, there are 2 cups of tea and you have to extract the 5th letter in each name of tea to form ‘t ’ (including blank space);

In the second example, there are 4 cups of tea and you have to extract the 3rd letter in each name of tea to form ‘rnbn’.

## Practice 3

**_\[Description\]_**

Punggaw is a curious girl, she loves playing many bizarre games that, for most of the time, puzzled her hanhan Punglau. Today, Punggaw comes up with a new strange game, and she explains the rule to Punglau:

For N words in a list, for each of them, extract the Nth letter and make up a word.

After hearing this, Punglau buries.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

5

Yeah

Wow wow

Scottish Straight

Hosico

Garlic cheese toast

**_\[Output Example\]_**

Yooii

**_\[Instructions\]_**

Extract 0th letter in the 0th word, which is ‘Y’ in ‘Yeah’

Extract 1st letter in the 1st word, which is ‘o’ in ‘Wow wow’

.

.

.

Extract 4th letter in the 4th word, which is ‘i’ in ‘Garlic cheese toast’

## Practice 4

**_\[Description\]_**

Punggaw finally returns to UCB!!! After meeting her classmates, they unanimously elect Punggaw as their technology chairman, for she’s the only one in the art major who has mastered Python3!!!

Immediately, Punggaw’s mentor gives her a task:

To decide who to be the teacher’s assistant, the mentor plans to choose the one has the longest name. The mentor would like to tell you how many students are there, so that Punggaw can put them into a list, and generate the teacher’s assistant.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

Punglau

Jiang Ying

SAY

**_\[Output Example\]_**

Jiang Ying

## Practice 5

**_\[Description\]_**

How time flies! Punggaw has been in the campus for almost a semester, and subsequently, Punggaw has to take her first final in the UCB. After going through her practices, Punggaw is uncontrollably excited, because she finds out that her correctness possibility for each single question is 90%. But her mentor tells her, albeit 90%, it is still not easy to get a 100 full mark in the impending exam. Punggaw doesn’t believe her mentor, so she decided to remonstrate by calculating the possibility herself.

Presuming that Punggaw wants a 50% chance to get a full mark, how many questions, at most, should be presented by teachers.

## Practice 6

**_\[Description\]_**

胖刘不太聪明的样子。最近他老是搞不清楚标点符号怎么用，

胖高很担心！所以就设计了一个程序来帮胖刘检查标点符号的对错？

这个程序是这样的；

把所有出现在非句子末尾的句点找出来并统计个数。若末尾不是句点。则也算作错误，

**_\[Input Example 1\]_**

Punglau loves jinjianceng. Puanggaw loves too,

**_\[Output Example 1\]_**

2

**_\[Explanation 1\]_**

这个句子句中出现了”.”，且末尾不是”.”，则统计出两处。

**_\[Input Example 2\]_**

Punglau loves jinjianceng. Puanggaw loves too. but SAY and JAY don’t allow.

**_\[Output Example 2\]_**

2

**_\[Explanation 2\]_**

这个句子句中出现了两处”.”，但末尾符合规则，是”.”，则仅需要统计句中的两处。

## Practice 7

**_\[Description\]_**

Punglau is a math geek, but he actually doesn’t know anything about math…

Recently he is befuddled by a math trick, which is:

Based on the mode F(n) = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + … + 1/n

For each n, what an integer must be, as small as possible, to be bigger than F(n).

For an input, Punggaw will get an n from Punglau, and outputs an integer that meets the requirement.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

3

**_\[Output Example\]_**

2

**_\[Explanation\]_**

Given n is 3, so F(n) = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 = 1.8333333…

So the legal integer would be 2. (2 is the known smallest integer that bigger than 1.8333333…)

## Practice 8

## Practice 9

**_\[Description\]_**

Punglau is obsessed with HeyTea and Starbucks, he is extremely happy to know that, with every 3 cups of HeyTea, he can get a coupon for a cup of Starbucks for FREE!!

So suggesting Punggaw buys X cups of HeyTea and Y cups Starbucks for Punglau, how many cups of HeyTea & Starbucks, IN TOTAL, can Punglau drink.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

7

2

**_\[Output Example\]_**

11

**_\[Explanation\]_**

According to the description, in 7 cups of HeyTea, 2 cups additional is for free, so in all, there are 7 + 2 + 2 cups for Punglau to drink.

## Practice 10

**_\[Description\]_**

One day, what a coincidence, the manager of HeyTea happened to walk into Punggaw. At that very moment, Punggaw was buying her 7 cups of HeyTea for Punglau. The manager was touched by Punggaw’s largess and named Punggaw the SVIP of HeyTea!! Which means Punggaw can get access to the privilege that, no matter under what circumstance, as long as Punggaw has 3 cups of HeyTea in her hands, she can get 1 extra for free.

Punglau was even happier when he hears this, so Punggaw, to feed her dumbass boyfriend well, has to calculate how many cups can she get in a purchase.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

14

**_\[Output Example\]_**

19

**_\[Explanation\]_**

According to the description:

\[14 / 3\] = 4

\[4 / 3\] = 1

(where \[…\] means int(…))

So, at last, there are 19 cups.

## Practice 11

**_\[Description\]_**

PungLau went to the lottery yesterday, and the staff told him, you can win $999,999,999 if your ticket matches the following rule:  
Every lottery ticket has 5 digits: ABCDE, and mathematically, 10000 ≤ ABCDE ≤ 30000  
Divide the digits to 3 groups: ABC, BCD, CDE, and the lottery machine will give you a number, from 1 to 100, randomly. If every devided part can be divide perfectly by that random number, you win the prize.  
Punglau wants to YiYeBaoFu, so he tries to simulate himself first, but he doesn’t even know how to do so, then, as usual, he turns to Punggaw.  
Punggaw thinks to try so many times is inefficient, so she prefers telling Punglau all the exact numbers that matches the random number.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

15

**_\[Output Example\]_**

22555  
25555  
28555  
30000

**_\[Explanation\]_**

According to the description:  
The first that matches, 22555, after being divided into 3 parts, 225, 255, 555, can all be divided by 15 perfectly.

## Practice 12

**_\[Description\]_**

Punglau lost his sleep yesterday, this morning, he was so dizzy that he himself didn’t realize he was counting meaninglessly, from 1 to infinity. At the meantime, he also counted how many times did, each of the digits, from 0 to 9, appear.

Presuming that punglau counted from M to N, how many times did each of the digit from 0 to 9 appear?

**_\[Input Example\]_**

129

137

**_\[Output Example\]_**

1 10 2 9 1 1 1 1 0 1

**_\[Explanation\]_**

From 129 to 137 (inclusively), the digit 0 appears for 1 time, and the digit 1 appears for 10 times…

## Practice 13

**CHALLENGE!!!**

**_\[Description\]_**

Punglau and Punggaw finally purchase a nice condo in a villa! The villa is so nice, the neighbors, the ambience… except for street signs. Punggaw and Punglau can only determine where they are by looking at the different colors of the houses nearby.

Suggesting R represents red, G represents green, B represents blue, P represents pink. To locate where they are, in other words, is to look for a minimized number of house colors they have to look at, which also, in other words again, is to look for a minimized number of adjacent colors that makes every combination different.

**_\[Input Example 1\]_**

RGBPRGBP

**_\[Output Example 1\]_**

5

**_\[Explanation\]_**

Let’s check it step by step:

If only one color is examined, the location cannot be determined because there are more than one R, and the same is true of G, B and P (RGBPRGBP);

Examining 2 colors is not enough neither, because there are more than one RG, GB, or BP;

Examining 3 or 4 colors is also not enough for the same reason.

Only when 5 colors, every 5 adjacent colors makes sets that different from one another. (RGBPR GBPRG BPRGB PRGBP)

**_\[Input Example 2\]_**

RBGPRGB

Punggaw is about to get her driver’s license! Punglau is so excited about it and looking forward to ride on Punggaw’s car every day and night. But JAY tells him, Punggaw cannot drive her car on corresponding car-restricted day, which is determined by the last digit of her 6-LETTER car number, or her driver’s license would be highly possible to be confiscated.

So Punggaw and Punglau sits down to check the restriction rule, and the rule goes like this:

DAY

Mon

## Practice 20

**_\[Description\]_**

Punggaw learnt how to use “class” yesterday!

She is so excited that she can’t wait to try it herself, so she plans to develop a mathematical toolkit for Punglau, to help him with his study.

Punggaw intends to includes these following methods to her toolkit:

1.  Add “+” (.add(x));
2.  Subtract “-” (.sub(x));
3.  Multiply “*” (.mul(x));
4.  Divide “/” (.div(x));
5.  Remainder “%” (.rem(x));
6.  Power “**” (.pow(x));
7.  Factorial (.fac());

**_\[Explanation\]_**

1.  For any integer N, after running N.add(x), N becomes N+x;
2.  For any integer N, after running N.sub(x), N becomes N-x;
3.  For any integer N, after running N.mul(x), N becomes N*x;
4.  For any integer N, after running N.div(x), N becomes N/x, keep to the integer;
5.  For any integer N, after running N.rem(x), N becomes N%x;
6.  For any integer N, after running N.pow(x), N becomes N**x;
7.  For any integer N, after running N.fac(), N becomes N*(N-1)*(N-2)*…*1.

**_\[Special Requirement\]_**

Use “class” in Python.

## Practice 21

**SYNTHESIS!!!**

**_\[Description\]_**

Punggaw is ordained as the student-leader of her class, directly report to the headmaster of the school. Recently, the headmaster needs Punggaw to develop a Python program to help him with some statistics analysis.

The requirement is this:

1.  The system will firstly ask the administrator to input how many students will be in this analysis class. Presuming there will be 5 students, the survey will run 5 times until the recording section ends;
2.  The system will orderly ask each of the individual to input their name, height, weight and sight, and record these data (all data in integer form _except_ for sight);
3.  After all the surveys are completed, the system will ask if the administrator would like to print the data, if the answer is YES, print the list, else directly move to the next operation;
4.  Lastly, separately print the average height, weight and sight. To augment accuracy, the biggest and the smallest for each part will be waived.

(For example, given the sequence \[99,1,14,16\], the biggest 99 and the smallest 1 will be waived when we calculate the average of this sequence, which makes the average 15.)

Based on the calculation way mentioned above, proportionately weigh every section to get the final score, and if the score if no less than 90, print “Lollipop!!!” on the screen, otherwise print “Bad Punglau!!!”.

## Practice 25

**_\[Description\]_**

Punglau discovers a brand-new game! This game is literally copied from Animal-Crossing in its fishing part. There could be a fish in any second, the player must click Enter in **_0.6s_** to catch the fish.

Unfortunately, Punglau don’t know how to make this game, so he comes to Punggaw.

**_\[Learn Something New!\]_**

Use this to do time-delay and timing.

  This import is necessary, and should be put at the very beginning of the program to include a library because you want to use the tools in this library. The same is true of random.

**_\[Explanation\]_**

For any x seconds between 3 and 6, after x seconds, the screen will show “FISH”, and synchronically the system will start timing until the player click Enter. If the time gap is less than 0.6s, print “CAUGHT!!!”, otherwise “QWQ”.

Punglau discovers a brand-new game! This game is literally copied from Animal-Crossing in its fishing part. There could be a fish in any second, the player must click Enter in **_0.6s_** to catch the fish.

**_AND_**, the fish will be of different weight, from **_10 pounds to 20 pounds_**. The player must hit the Enter button very fast to catch the fish.

Unfortunately, Punglau don’t know how to make this game, so he comes to Punggaw.

Use this to do time-delay and timing.

  This import is necessary, and should be put at the very beginning of the program to include a library because you want to use the tools in this library. The same is true of random.

**_\[Explanation\]_**

For any x seconds between 3 and 6, after x seconds, the screen will show “FISH” and the fish’s weight x pounds, so the screen will actually show this: “FISH xPounds”, and synchronically the system will start timing. The player must start hitting Enter in 0.6s and immediately continue hitting for x times to catch the fish, and each 2 hits’ gap must be shorter than 0.3s any one of these conditions fails, the player lose the fish. If the player succeeds, print “CAUGHT!!!”, otherwise “QWQ”.

**_\[Description\]_**

Punggaw is a cute girl! And she loves cute kitties!

Punglau is a han boy! So he loves han dogs!

One day, they went to the pet shop hand in hand, and Punggaw saw some fluffy Jinjiancengs, but Punglau saw some fat Chaiquans. They love them all, but only some of them can be brought home considering their pecuniary condition.

Punggaw and Punglau had X dollars, and a Jinjianceng is A dollars, a Chaiquan is B dollars, so how could they spend money to make their money most used? (Which means to spend their money as much as they can by buying a certain combination of Jinjianceng and Chaiquan.)

In this program, Punggaw will input X, A, B in order, and the program will tell how many Jinjianceng and Chaiquan they can afford and the money left.

**_\[Input Example\]_**

5000

2000

300

**_\[Output Example\]_**

2 3 100

**_\[Explanation\]_**

Punggaw and Punglau have $5000, a Jinjianceng costs $2000, while a Chaiquan costs $300. So, to spend money as much as they can, they have to buy 2 Jinjiancengs and 3 Chaiquans to make their money most used. Under this combination of purchasing, $100 will remain.

Punggaw finally gets enrolled in the UCB UX research class! The mentor says the first mission is to make a n*m grid (F.Y.I. We call this kind of grids, matrix) user interface to store function blocks. To simplify the work, we temporarily use the letter “O” as a substitute of a block.

The mentor will provide the size needed by inputting n & m separately.

Punggaw had done well in her first class, which is very inspiring so Punggaw decides to design a solid user interface by herself. Considering the graphical aesthetics, the interface must be somewhat modified and decorated.

Given a template of a window:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

*      *

Here comes a fact:

Since create a window is so frequently used, so we don’t have to code so many lines every time we want to create a window. So, what comes to our mind? FUNCTION! For sure!

In this section Punggaw needs to design a function to simplify the work, which create a window that includes contents inside.

*Contents is in the first line of the window.

One frequent application of programming is to do something to the file that already exists, like calculating the average of a grade book, or sort an unarranged name list by the first letter of each name based on the A-Z order. So it is of vital importance to get familiar with some common file functions and methods in Python programming.

To edit a file, first we need to open it. Let’s look at an example of opening a file:

file = open("filename.txt", "r")

Here, file is a special data type, it represents a file, which is opened by .open() following. In .open(), you can see two _constant str_ type value, where “filename.txt” indicates exactly the name of the file to be edited, and “r” commands the operation to this file, which means “read”.

This is how reading a file to the program is done.

But as your experience tells you, to edit a file, just reading is far from enough: We need to write things into the file as well.

So, here is how writing a file is done:

file = open("filename.txt", "w")

By doing this, you can write things to the file filename.txt. Similarly, the “w” means “write”.

But before using this “w”, one thing should be prewarned, “w” will, no matter if there is anything previously in this file, clean up the file as a new and start writing, which is quite inconvenient if you want to edit based on contents that have already existed.

So here we introduce: “a+”, means “append+”.

file = open("filename.txt", "a+")

This way is quite versatile, you can either read or write, and what’s more, you can write things follow the existing part without cleaning them as “w” does, and this way can ensure no error will happen when opening the file because it will automatically create a new file named “filename.txt” if there’s no file named that.

Besides “r”, “w” and “a+”, there are many other ways to edit a file.

When we need to extract data from a pure data file, such as a file like this:

We can read and load data to a list like this:

file = open("scores.txt", "r")

line = file.readlines()

print(line)

In this bunch of codes, .readlines() is a method to read all the lines, which veritably equals to all the contents of the file “scores.txt”, and store them into a list which is created by you. Here the list is line.

After running, a list named line is created, the content is as below.

As we can see, all data types are str, so in order to get the average score (apparently this is an int type), we need to devise a algorithm to convert these strs to ints, and calculate.
