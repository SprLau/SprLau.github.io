## FOREWORD

This is a handy tool to disassemble 32-bit hexadecimal raw code into MIPS instructions. The application is at its inception, so many advanced instructions or not-so-frequently-used instructions are not supported at this moment.<br>
So far, 10 instructions are supported: **addu, subu, or, ori, jal, jr, beq, lui, lw, sw, nop**.<br>
More instructions will be added as the BUAA Computer Organiazation Courses pushing forward, but before that, if you are willing to devote your leisure time to help this disassembly tool get better, I will be extremely pleased. Both the source code and the application are open to download and use.<br>
