## Introduction
To examine if those seemingly remembered words actually have come into your brain, this APP gets words from an existing *WordList.txt*, whose format is strictly *.txt*, and randomly selects a word at a time. If you find yourself cannot recall its meaning at once, the system will automatically record what you can't remember into the file *ScoreRecord.txt*, where you can revise what you have forgotten or obscurely memorized.
