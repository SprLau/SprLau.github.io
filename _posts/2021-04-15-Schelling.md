## FOREWORD

**Schelling's model of segregation** is an [agent-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) developed by [economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist) [Thomas Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling). Schelling's model does not include outside factors that place pressure on agents to segregate such as [Jim Crow laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws) in the United States, but Schelling's work does demonstrate that having people with "mild" in-group preference towards their own group could still lead to a highly segregated society via [de facto segregation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_segregation). (**From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation)*)
