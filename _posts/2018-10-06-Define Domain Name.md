## FOREWORD

After a blog is settled(e.g. GitHub Pages), we can attach a domain name for it to facilitate access.

## PURCHASE

Visit [AliYun](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/domain/) to purchase a domain name.

## ALALYZING DOMAIN NAME

After successfully getting your own domain name, click **解析** to analyze it.

Click "Add Document", and "Document Value" corresponds to your blog's IP, which can be obtained by ping commands.

## Modifying CNAME Document

Lastly, modify the CNAME file under our lib to our own content.

## BINGO!!!

Now, type in, and access.

## *Additional Attention*

If at the very beginning you enable Gittalk but haven't yet attach your blog to a domain name, then you should consider revising OAuth APPS.
