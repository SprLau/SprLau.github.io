# How Digital Memory Will Change Us in the Next 5 Decades



## Forewords

The technology of digits is changing, refining,  evoluting in every second, and will continue in this way long as scientists are still keeping on exploring natural and artificial memories, engineers are still designing, testing and remaking hardwares and softwares or developers are still pushing new products to the markets. Today, we are like befuddled juveniles in their most awkward times, realizing that though huge amounts of energy we’ve gain, we have no ways to use them, let along to control them. Like teenagers, we’ve found the future, and also have noticed tempting potentials in the future, hence we seldomly look back, hence we forget the pasts.

The first generation of Digital Natural-Borns, are not even reaching their middle ages, which is the period when people sit down,  rethink, recap what have been done along with what have not been done, and start to concern about how people apart from themselves judge them.

We currently have no enough power to adapt this way, where videos and audios recording everything that ever happend to us, and information chasing behind us, reforming us all the time. Only after we have shared our lives with digits for more than decades, can we control us, instead of digits, prevent ourselves from being affected, physically and mentally.

## The Overload of Information Will Die Soon

For every individual that is born in the 21st century, digital viewings are pre-set and consequently,  natural. Digital Natural-Borns will never regard information as something that can be overloaded, becuase this is exactly the way they are born in, that information is no longer a burden. They grew up with tons of information that could be impossible to get in their fathers’ times, and they have such instinct to filter and organize them in their minds.

Taking padestrians for an example, the most common approach to filter information is to select how much we need and what we need. Metaphorically speaking, a pair of invisible ear plugs, that helps people censor and catch information from uncountable sources. Such ear plugs regain our control and autonomy over texting, surfing the Internet or other digital activities, 

The explosion of information have already been a past term, it is just a little disturbance in the updating digital era, and it can also promisingly be seen that, not long from now, it will fade from history, just like in the old times that kind of excitation when we receive a telegram from people we love far away. We’d be willing to talk about it on dinner tables, but none of us believe it could happen again.

## Benefits and Jeopardies

Digital memories make families, lovers, friends reunion more convenient than ever, make industries more systematized and profitable, and also make it a lot more equal in knowledge gaining. These are just a tiny corner of the benefits that digital memories bring us, nd all these come from an one true base, big data. 

Paradoxically, it is exactly big data that make it so dangerous. We must admit the lapses of regulations on data controls, we have seen how much damage it can cause from hundreds of events, such as the national security disaster in USA triggered by Edward Snodden. Being submerged in such big data, no one that has attached himself/herself to the Internet can be guaranteed 100% safety, even for some, they can be as transparent as if their houses are make of glass. The basic attributes of digital data is that they are uncontrollable, unpredictable, and unpreventable. People are over-confident in digital security, we tend to formulate rational logics for things that have happened and believe in such man-made logics, hence we can’t see our limited ability in predicting. This is horrible, we are supposed to be horrified by digital memories, instead of being confident in the belief that we can make it go in our way.

## Hopes

First things first, I hope we can be more awared of how pasts form future, and we will use such consciousness to accelerate digital infrastructure development, and build a more secured (as I said, 100% safety is not possible, but let’s do what we can do) information administration system, providing a more safe way to store group memories and individual memories.

Secondly, I hope that we can learn from how Mother Nature organize herself, how she manage to make everything in order, and hopefully we can apply such method to our data organization.

Last but not least, even the most important one, is that we leave tasks like storing, searching and indexing memories to machines, which are more capable in doing such things than us human-beings, and we can spend the spared time cultivating our emotions and senses, attributes that make us human. In a machines-driven world, they are ever necessary.
