## FOREWORD

This is not actually a fully optimized set of functions, many, or veritably all of them are originated from casual practices.
BUT:
They are capable to deal with schoolworks, and all the functions are named straightforwardly.
WHICH IS TO SAY:
It is not advisable to apply this set of functions in certain real industrial or professional research programs which acquires algorithms that are more state-of-the-art.
