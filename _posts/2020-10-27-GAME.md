## INTRODUCTION
When the game is started, the system will ask the players to input how many players that will attend this game and seperately input each player's name.<br>
Initially, each player's starting HP will be 100, and for each round, the attacker will assign a target and the system will automatically draw damage to the target. When a player's HP drops below or equals zero, this player is judged "DEAD.", which means he/she cannot continue the playing, the system will automatically skip the DEADs when his/her round comes.<br>
There will be no winner unless only one survivor stands.<br><br>
