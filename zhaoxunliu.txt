Hi there! I'm Zhaoxun Liu, you can also call me Springs. I'm an undergraduate student at <a href ="https://buaa.edu.cn/">Beihang University, also known as BUAA</a>, majoring in <a href ="https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/">Computer Science</a>. My research interests mainly are: 

<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_computing">Visual Computing (VISION & GRAPHICS)</a>: 
a concentration for all computer science disciplines dealing with images and 3D models, such as computer graphics, image processing, visualization, computer vision, virtual and augmented reality and video processing.

<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</a>: 
a magic to bring human beings and computing machines together in a harmonious way.


I have been pondering how machines can break out of their computational boundaries to understand human intelligence. My goal is to develop computationally efficient machine learning as well as deep learning models and algorithms, building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions.

Do you want to see some of my projects? <a href="https://github.com/SprLau"> Here you go</a>.


I'm always open to collaborations on pure-cs or interdisciplinary research topics, feel free to <a href="mailto: lau@buaa.edu.cn">contact me through e-mail</a>!


Cheers!
